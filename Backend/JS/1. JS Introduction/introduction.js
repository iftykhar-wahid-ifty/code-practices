ðŸ“˜ Introduction to JavaScript â€“ Theory Overview
ðŸ”¹ What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language used primarily to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It runs in the browser and allows developers to manipulate HTML/CSS, handle events, and communicate with servers â€” all without reloading the page.
-ðŸ’¡ Unlike HTML (structure) and CSS (styling), JavaScript controls behavior.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of JavaScript
- Client-Side Execution: JS typically runs in the user's browser, which allows real-time interaction without needing server responses.
- Interpreted Language: No compilation needed. The browser interprets the code line by line.
- Dynamically Typed: Variable types are determined at runtime (e.g., a variable can hold a number, then a string).
- Object-Based: Everything in JS is an object or can behave like one (functions, arrays, etc.).
- Event-Driven: JS responds to user actions like clicks, key presses, form submissions, etc.
- Single-Threaded: JS executes one command at a time, but it uses asynchronous mechanisms (like setTimeout, fetch) to handle long tasks efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ JavaScript in the Browser
- Browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine (like Google Chrome's V8 or Firefox's SpiderMonkey) that runs JS code. It can:
- Access and modify HTML via the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Handle browser events (e.g., button clicks)
- Send/receive data using AJAX or Fetch API

ðŸ”¹ What JavaScript is NOT
- It is not the same as Java (despite the similar name).
- It is not a compiled language like C++ or Java.
- It is not just for browsers â€” it can also run on servers via Node.js.

ðŸ”¹ Importance of JavaScript
- JavaScript is the backbone of modern web development. It powers:
- Frontend frameworks like React, Vue, Angular
- Backend via Node.js
- Mobile apps (e.g., React Native)
- Desktop apps (e.g., Electron)
