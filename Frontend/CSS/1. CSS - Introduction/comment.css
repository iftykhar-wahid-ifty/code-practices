    What is CSS?
        - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It defines how elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

    Purpose of CSS
        - Separates content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)
        - Enhances design flexibility and site maintainability
        - Allows the same HTML page to have different looks across devices or screen sizes

    Key Concepts in CSS
    1. Selectors: 
        - Specify which HTML elements the styles apply to.
    2. Properties and Values: 
        - Define what aspect of the element to style and how.
    3. Cascading and Inheritance: 
        - Cascading determines which styles are applied when multiple rules match (based on specificity and source order).
        - Inheritance allows some properties to be passed from parent to child elements.
    4. Box Model: Every HTML element is treated as a box with:
        - content
        - padding
        - border
        - margin

    Types of CSS: 
        Inline CSS 	    – Applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute
        Internal CSS 	– Defined within <style> tags in the HTML document's <head>
        External CSS 	– Linked through a separate .css file using <link> tag

    Advantages of CSS:
    - Cleaner and more maintainable code
    - Consistent design across multiple pages
    - Reduces code duplication
    - Enables responsive web design
