1. HTML Elements: 
------------------
An HTML element is the building block of HTML. It usually consists of:
    - An opening tag
    - Some content
    - A closing tag

Exmple: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>                     - is the opening tag
This is a paragraph     - is the content
</p>                    - is the closing tag

Tags are keywords enclosed in angle brackets like <tagname>.

2. Types of tags:
------------------
Paired Tags                 - Have an opening and a closing part
Self-closing (Void) Tags    - Do not have closing tags

Paired Tags:
<h1>Hello</h1>

Self-closing Tags:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />
<br />

3. HTML Attributes
--------------------
Attributes provide additional information about elements. They are always placed in the opening tag and follow the name="value" format.

Example:
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit Site</a>

Here:
href specifies the URL
target="_blank" opens the link in a new tab
